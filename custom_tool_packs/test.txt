Let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves.
The world has kissed my soul with its pain, asking for its return in songs.
“Eyes are raining for her，heart is holding umbrella for her，this is love”.
The waterfall sing, "I find my song, when I find my freedom."
Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away. And yellow leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall there with a sign.
